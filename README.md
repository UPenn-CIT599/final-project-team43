### CALCULATOR FUNCTIONALITIES - HOW TO RUN
* Go to the Runner class and click Run
* The first form will appear:

![Life Expectancy Form](./image/LifeExpectancyForm.jpg)

* Choose the appropriate gender and current age (between 18 and 64 for a working Canadian). Then click Next. The second form as above will appear. 

![Capital Form](./image/CapitalForm.jpg)

* It first lets the user know their expected age of death. This will be used  into the calculation of the retirement plan.
The user then choose their Retirement Age (between 65 and 85) and  provide positive integers for their retirement plan, specifically:
1. What is their target annual retirement income (that they will earn between retirement age until they expect to die)?
2. What is their expected annual savings between current age and retirement age?
* Once the users provide all the inputs, it will shows the projections of savings between current age and retirement age to illustrate how much savings will need to grow in order to have enough savings to pay out the target annual retirement income during retirement years. It also provides the minimum interest rate required to invest the savings in order to achieve the target annual retirement income during retirement years until the expected age of death.
